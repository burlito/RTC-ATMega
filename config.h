*/
/**
	F_CPU is used for computinf purporses

	RTC_PRESCALER will setup RTC prescaling int TC1
		allowed values are 1, 64, 256, 1024

	Optimization macros:
		RTC_MS_RESOLUTION if defined library will be
			compiled with milissecond support

		RTC_US_RESOLUTION if defined library will be
			compiled with microsecond support

		RTC_32_BIT if defined library will be compiled
			with 32 bit timer resolution support
			this will add about 4K (4/5 of all
			library) flash space.

		in case you're using RTC_US_RESOLUTION it's
		highli recommended use RTC_32_BIT too
